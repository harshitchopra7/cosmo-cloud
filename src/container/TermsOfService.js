        extent that Cosmocloud is required by law to pay any such taxes, duties,
        or other charges to any governmental or regulatory authority, Cosmocloud
        may invoice Customer for such taxes, duties, or other charges and
        Customer will pay such invoiced amounts in accordance with this
        Agreement.

        would be considered confidential by a reasonable person given the nature
        of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure (collectively,

        receiving Party's employees, contractors, and agents who have a need to
        know the Confidential Information for the receiving Party to exercise

        receiving Party will be responsible for all the acts and omissions of
        its Representatives as they relate to Confidential Information
        hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose
        Confidential Information to the limited extent required (i) in order to
        comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as
        otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the
        Party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given
        written notice to the other Party and made a reasonable effort to obtain
        a protective order; or (ii) to establish a Party's rights under this
        Agreement, including to make required court filings. Further,
        notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose the terms and
        existence of this Agreement to its actual or potential investors,
        debtholders, acquirers, or merger partners under customary
        confidentiality terms.

        Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in
        writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has
        been destroyed. Each Party's obligations of non-use and non-disclosure
        with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the
        Effective Date and will expire three (3) years from the date of
        termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, with
        respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret
        (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure
        will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long
        as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret
        protection under applicable law.

        reasonably designed to provide notice to Customer. If Customer accesses
        or uses the Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement,
        such access and use will constitute Customer's acceptance of the revised

        be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an
        injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be
